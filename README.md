# aponica/image-utils-php

Common image manipulations in PHP.

Current manipulations include:

* Centering lines of text over an image.
* Correcting the orientation of an image.
* Fitting an image by cropping and/or scaling.

## Installation

```sh
composer install aponica/image-utils-php
```

<a name="example"></a>
## Example

```php
use function Aponica\ImageUtils\fCenterTextLines;
use function Aponica\ImageUtils\fiFitImage;
use function Aponica\ImageUtils\fiLoadOrientedImage;

//  Load the image, rotating it if necessary.

$oriented = fiLoadOrientedImage( 'example.jpg' );

//  Scale and/or crop the image to size 800x600.

$resized = fiFitImage( 800, 600, $oriented );

//  Overlay two lines of red text in Helvetica type. 

fCenterTextLines(
  [ 'iImage' => $resized,
    'avLines' => [ 'First Text Line', 'Second Text Line' ] ],
  [ 'iColor' => imagecolorallocate( $resized, 255, 0, 0 ),
    'zFontFileName' => 'helvetica.ttf' ]
  );
```

## Unit Testing

The [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) unit tests compare images created during
the testing process to images that were created beforehand. 

Before you change any code, be sure to run this command from the package root 
directory (the one *containing* `tests-config`):

```sh
php tests-config/CreateControlImages.php
```

`CreateControlImages.php` creates the control images (hence its name!),
placing them in a `tests-images` directory.

If you don't run the script beforehand, there will be no control images and
the tests will always fail.

If you run the script *after* making changes, the unit tests might pass
even if you introduced a breaking change, because you will be comparing
current images against themselves.

Consult `tests-config/CreateControlImages.php` for detailed instructions on
creating new unit tests that leverage this functionality.
